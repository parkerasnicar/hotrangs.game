Boomerang Fu Star League (BFSL) is Australia’s premier competitive league for the video game Boomerang Fu. 
The brand blends the vibrant energy of video-game combat with a fun, modern, street-inspired aesthetic. 
It should feel playful yet competitive — a balance between esports professionalism and quirky party-game chaos.

The identity takes inspiration from stickers, street murals, tournament posters, and retro-modern arcade visuals.
